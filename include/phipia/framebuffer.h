 * idea what a character, a window or a cursor is. Those are built on this, and
 * each is its own increment.
 *
 * The claim it makes is narrow and completely checkable without looking at a
 * screen, which matters because CONTRIBUTING.md says screenshots are not proof:
 * for every visible coordinate, the colour written there is the colour read
 * back, and no coordinate aliases another.
