 * The PS/2 keyboard, through the 8042 controller.
 *
 * This is the first device Phipia talks to that a person operates. Everything
 * before it was discovered, counted, or timed; this one waits.
 *
 * The 8042 is not a keyboard. It is a controller with two ports, a command
 * register and a status register, and it long ago stopped being an actual
 * physical part - on anything modern it is emulated by the platform controller
 * hub or by a system management handler. That matters here because it means its
 * timings are nothing like a datasheet's, so every wait in this driver is
 * bounded and every bound is a refusal rather than a spin.
