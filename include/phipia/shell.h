 *
 * It is deliberately split so that almost none of it needs a keyboard. Feeding
 * characters and running a line are ordinary functions over a buffer, and the
 * interactive loop is a thin layer that reads keys and calls them. That is what
 * makes the shell testable at all: boot proves it by feeding a scripted line,
