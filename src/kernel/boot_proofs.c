 * correctly and never reaches a command, and a command is worthless if it runs
 * and nothing appears.
 *
 * So the scancodes for "echo hi" are pushed through the 8042's own 0xD2
 * command, taken by IRQ 1, decoded by the keyboard driver, drained out of its
 * queue, fed to the shell one character at a time exactly as shell_run does,
 * executed, written to the console, drawn by the screen console - and then read
 * back out of the framebuffer, pixel by pixel, and compared against the font.
 *
 * Nothing in that sentence is simulated except the finger.
