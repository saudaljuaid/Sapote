//! The console font: a bounded reader for a packed bitmap glyph table.
//!
//! The table is produced by `tools/make-font-asset.py` from the ASCII art in
//! `tools/font8x16.txt`. Doing the parsing at development time leaves the
//! kernel a format it can validate in a single pass with no allocation, which
//! matters here more than it did for the logo: the console runs before almost
//! everything, and a font lookup happens once per character printed.
//!
//! Every field in the header is a length or an index, and every one of them is
//! used to compute an offset into the blob. That is the entire argument for
//! this file being Rust - the bounds checks belong to the compiler rather than
//! to whoever remembers to write them.
