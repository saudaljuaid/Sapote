//! The parts of Sapote written in Rust.
//!
//! Sapote is a C kernel. Rust is used here for one specific job: parsing input
//! this kernel did not produce. A bounds check that the compiler inserts and
//! cannot be talked out of is worth more on a byte stream from outside than
//! anywhere else, because that is where a missing one becomes an attacker's
//! primitive rather than a bug.
//!
//! It is deliberately *not* used for the layers that talk to hardware. Page
//! tables, port I/O and the context switch are unsafe operations by nature:
//! writing them in Rust would wrap every line in `unsafe` and buy nothing but
//! a second language in the boot path. `docs/RUST.md` argues that split.
//!
//! The whole crate compiles with no operating system. The ext4 parser uses
//! Sapote's bounded kernel heap through the allocator boundary in [`abi`]; the
//! older parsers remain allocation-free. Unsafe code is confined to that ABI
//! boundary, which turns validated C pointers into Rust slices, writes results
//! through validated C pointers, and calls the kernel allocator and block I/O.

/// and the crate is built with `panic=abort` so unwinding does not exist. This
/// is the backstop for a bounds check the compiler inserted that this code did
/// not anticipate - which is exactly the class of bug Rust is here to convert
