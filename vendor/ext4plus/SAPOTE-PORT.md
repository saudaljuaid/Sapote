# Sapote ext4plus port boundary

Sapote vendors the `src/` tree from ext4plus commit
`ec7e8443e474376977bb752cde370762226a5a50` as its sole ext4
implementation candidate. Upstream's MIT and Apache-2.0 notices are retained
unchanged.

The source was selected because it is designed for `no_std` + `alloc`, has a
caller-supplied block I/O contract, performs broad checked ext4 metadata
validation, supports extents and 64-bit files, and already implements the
required read/write object operations.

The unmodified commit does **not** provide journaled writes. It reads and
validates an existing JBD2 journal but sends mutations directly to home blocks.
Sapote must not expose the backend read-write or claim crash consistency until
the port adds an ordered, checksummed JBD2 writer over Sapote's explicit NVMe
Flush fence and passes deliberate power-loss tests. Read-only mount admission
may be integrated before that point.

Sapote-specific changes stay in reviewable commits and are summarized here as
they land. The intended port configuration is `--no-default-features
--features sync`; the asynchronous and hosted `std` surfaces are out of scope.
The vendored manifest replaces workspace-inherited edition/license fields and
removes upstream-only `xtask`/dev dependencies because those sources and test
fixtures are deliberately outside the runtime vendor boundary.

Vendored scope is intentionally limited to `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, the two
license files, `README.md`, and `src/`. Upstream test disk images, `xtask`, and
host integration tests are not runtime build inputs and are not vendored.
